<p>
  If you follow one person on this list, have it be Sylvie. She's done more for
  the sport than anyone else I've seen, and her <a

<p>
  James Nichol is a professional nutritionist for Nak Muay, and has also had
  severe injuries that he has been very open about his recovery from. With those
  two things together, he is a wealth of information for fighters at all levels.

  Heatrick has an enormous amount of information for training, weight managment,
  motivation, and more. One of my favorite things he's done is
